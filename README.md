# Data-Science-From-Scratch

I recently graduated from a Data Science Immersive Bootcamp through General Assembly(04/10/2018). In order to keep up with my data science skills, I purchased the book "Data Science from Scratch" by Joel Grus(O'Reilly Media, INC.). This repository will be all of the coding practices found throughout the book.

This repo will be updated as I make my way through the book.
